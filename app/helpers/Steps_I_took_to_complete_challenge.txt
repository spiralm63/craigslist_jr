downloaded sinatra skeleton and changed folder name to craigslist jr.

ran bundle

Then I created the database, ran 
  rake db:create
          -- it already existed on this machine, so had to run rake db:drop, and then I was able to succeessfully rerun rake db:create

Then I created the models:
  rake generate:model NAME=Post
  rake generate:model NAME=Category
      RESULT: Two new files were created in the app/models folder for me


Then the migrations:
  rake generate:migration NAME=create_posts
  rake generate:migration NAME=create_categories
      RESULT: Two new files were created in the db/migrate folder for me

Then I modified the migrations files (in the db/migrate folder) by adding the 
    create_table :table_name do |t| 
      routine to the files (look in the migration files to see)

Then I ran:
  rake db:migrate

Then I did a git commit:
    git init
    git add  .
    git commit -m "first commit"
    git remote add origin https://github.com/spiralm63/craigslist_jr.git
    git push -u origin master  

Then I added active record relationships to the models (in the app/models folder for me):
 for post.rb:
  belongs_to :category
 for category.rb:
  has_many :posts

Then I tried to create a few lines in the db/seeds.rb file
