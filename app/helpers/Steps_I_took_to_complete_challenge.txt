downloaded sinatra skeleton and changed folder name to craigslist jr.

ran bundle

Create the database, ran 
  rake db:create
          -- it already existed on this machine, so had to run rake db:drop, and then I was able to succeessfully rerun rake db:created

Then I created the models:
  rake generate:model NAME=Post
  rake generate:model NAME=Category

Then the migrations:
  rake generate:migration NAME=create_posts
  rake generate:migration NAME=create_categories

Then I modified the migrations by adding the create_table :table_name do |t| routine to the files (look in the migration files to see)

Then I ran:
  rake db:migrate

Then I did a git commit:

git init
git add  .
git commit -m "first commit"
git remote add origin https://github.com/spiralm63/sinatra_sandbox.git
git push -u origin master
